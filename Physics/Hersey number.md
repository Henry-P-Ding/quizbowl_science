## Notes
The **Hersey number** is a [[dimensionless number]] defined as:
$$
\text{Hersey number} = \frac{\mu u}{P}
$$
- $\mu$ is [[dynamic viscosity]]
- $u$ is the [[entrainment speed]] of the fluid (how fast an object slides through the fluid)
- $P$ is the [[normal force|normal]] load per length

The Hersey number is a dimensionless number used to construct empirical curves, such as the [[Stribeck curve]], that can be applied to the [[Buckingham pi theorem]].
