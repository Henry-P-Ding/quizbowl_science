[[Mössbauer effect]], [[Mössbauer effect|Mössbauer spectroscopy]]
## Notes
The **Mössbauer effect** is an effect in which atomic [[nucleus|nuclei]] resonantly absorb [[gamma radiation]]. For certain gamma ray energies, the nuclear recoil from absorption (to conserve momentum) is transferred to the [[crystal]] lattice rather than the nucleus alone, which results in strong [[resonance]] with the gamma ray.
