### Answer Lines
[[viscosity]]
## Notes
**Thixotropy** is a property of [[gel|gels]] and [[fluid|fluids]] in which they become less [[viscosity|viscous]] if shaken, meaning that it is the opposite of [[rheopecty]]. It occurs because ordered structure for suspended particles or solutes takes time to form, so the fluid will lack structure if the structure is quickly disrupted. This behavior is common in [[colloid|colloids]]. Ketchup is a commonly thixotropic fluid.
