# Notes
## Chandrasekhar Limit
The **Chandrasekhar limit** is the maximum mass of a [[white dwarf]], above which [[electron degeneracy pressure]] can not resist gravitational collapse and a [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]] is formed. It is around $1.4$ solar masses.
## Structure
* Neutron stars have an [[atmosphere]] that is at most a few micrometers thick.
* The outer core of neutrons may consist of **nuclear pasta**, where nuclear attraction and Coulomb repulsion are of comparable magnitude, resulting in pasta-like structures.
* Cores consist of [[quark-gluon plasma]]. Neutron star cores *may* consist of **strange quark matter**, which is a phase of matter similar to [[quark-gluon plasma]] consisting of quarks not bound in protons and neutrons containing [[quark|strange quarks]].
## Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff Equation
The **Tolman–Oppenheimier–Volkoff Equation** (TOV equation) is an equation that constrains the structure of a spherically symmetric body of an istotropic material in static gravitational equilibrium. It relates the [[pressure]] and [[density]] with the $r$ radial coordinate:$$\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{Gm}{r^2}\rho\left(1 + \frac{P}{\rho c^2}\right)\left(1+\frac{4\pi r^3 P}{mc^2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{2Gm}{rc^2}\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}$$
The TOV equation can be used to set an upper limit of 0.7 solar masses for the gravitational mass of a neutron stars, but is inaccurate since it does not account for the neutron star **rotation.**
## Magnetar
A **magnetar** is a neutron start with a strong [[magnetic field]], which powers the emission of [[electromagnetic spectrum|x-rays]] and [[electromagnetic spectrum|gamma rays]].
