### Stainless Steel
There are five types of stainless steel by structure:
- **ferritic:** [[body-centered cubic|BCC]] [[iron|Fe]] arrangement, or $\alpha$-iron
- **austenitic:** [[face-centered cubic|FCC]] [[iron|Fe]] arrangement, or $\gamma$-iron
- **duplex:** [[body-centered cubic|BCC]], [[face-centered cubic|FCC]] [[iron|Fe]] arrangement in roughly equal amounts
- **martenisitic:** steel hardened by heat and aging
- **precipitation hardened:** steel hardened by adding fine particles into the [[crystal]], which impeded dislocations and facilitate plasticity. This is known as **supersaturation.**
