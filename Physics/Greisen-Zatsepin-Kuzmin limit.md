### Answer Lines
[[proton]], [[cosmic ray]], [[Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin limit]]
## Notes
The maximum energy limit on a [[cosmic ray]] [[proton]] is given by the **Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin limit,** due to its interaction with the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. The **Oh-My-God** particle famously violated this limit.
