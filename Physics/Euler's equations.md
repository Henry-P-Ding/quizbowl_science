### Answer Lines
[[viscosity]]
## Notes
The **Euler equations**, named after [[Leonhard Euler]]. are a set of quasilinear [[differential equation|partial differential equations]] that describe [[adiabatic]] and inviscid, or zero [[viscosity]], flow. They are a specific case of the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] when [[viscosity]] and [[thermal conductivity]] are zero.
