### Answer Lines
[[viscosity]]
## Notes
The **Grashof number** is a [[dimensionless number]] which determines the ratio of [[buoyancy]] to [[viscosity|viscous]] forces acting on a fluid, and is commonly encountered when dealing with [[convection]]. One form of the Grashof number for vertical flat plates is:$$\text{Gr}_L = \frac{g\beta(T_s - T_\infty)L^3}{\nu^2}$$
- $g$: [[gravitational acceleration]]
- $\beta$: [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] ($\approx 1/T$ for an [[ideal gas]])
- $\nu$ is [[viscosity|kinematic viscosity]]
- $L$ is vertical length
- $T_s$ is surface temperature, $T_\infty$ is the bulk temperature
