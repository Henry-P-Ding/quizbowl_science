[[zero]]
## Notes
**Color charge** is a charge of [[quarks]] and [[gluons]] that determines [[strong force]] interactions in QCD. All primary charge colors mix together to form form, which corresponds to a color charge of zero. A zero color charge can also be formed from a color and its complement (like red and cyan). Due to [[color confinement]], all free particles must have zero color charge.
