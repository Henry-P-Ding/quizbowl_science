### Answer Lines
[[viscosity]]
## Notes
**Viscosity** generally measures a fluid's resistance to flow. Due to friction within a fluid, the flow velocity varies throughout the fluid. If the velocity various linearly, the pressure $P$ in the direction of flow is described by:$$P=\mu \frac{u}{y}$$
where $\mu$ is **dynamic viscosity**, $u$ is [[flow velocity]], and $y$ is the height of the flow above a [[no-slip condition|no-slip]] surface:

This type is flow is described as **Couette flow:**

Alternatively, it is the ratio of shear [[stress]] and shear rate:$$\mu = \frac{\sigma}{\partial u/\partial y}$$
**Kinematic viscosity** $\nu$ is defined as $\nu  = \mu / \rho$ for a fluid with density $\rho$, which occasionally makes calculations more appropriate.

In Newtonian fluids, the viscosity is independent of [[strain rate]], or the rate of deformation in a fluid.
### Units
- The units for [[viscosity|dynamic viscosity]] are **poise** in CGS, named after [[Jean LÃ©onard Marie Poiseuille]]. It has dimensions of $F\times T/L^2$ or units of $\mathrm{Pa\cdot s = \frac{kg}{m}\cdot s = \frac{N}{m^2}\cdot s}$
- The units for [[viscosity|kinematic viscosity]] are **stokes** in CGS, named after [[Sir George Stokes]].
