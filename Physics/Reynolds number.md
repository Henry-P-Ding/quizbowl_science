[[friction]]
## Notes
The **Reynolds number** is a [[dimensionless number]] defined as:
$$
\begin{align}
	\mathrm{Re} \equiv \frac{\rho uL}{\mu} \equiv \frac{uL}{\nu}
\end{align}
$$
- $\rho$ is [[density]]
- $u$ is [[flow velocity]]
- $L$ is some characteristic length of the system
- $\mu$ is [[viscosity|dynamic viscosity]]
- $\nu$ is [[viscosity|kinematic viscosity]]

When $\mathrm{Re} \gg 1$ the [[boundary layer]] moves due to the [[no-slip condition]] more slower.

The Reynolds number is often encountered when using the [[Buckingham pi theorem]].
