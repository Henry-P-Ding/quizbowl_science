[[viscosity]]
## Notes
The **Prandtl number** is a [[dimensionless number]] named after [[Ludwig Prandtl]] defined as the ratio between [[viscosity|kinematic viscosity]] $\nu$ and thermal diffusivity $\alpha$, which is the [[thermal conductivity]] $k$ divided by [[density]] $\rho$ and [[specific heat]] $c$:$$\text{Pr} = \frac{\nu}{\alpha} = \frac{\mu / \rho}{k/(c\rho)} = \frac{c\mu}{k}$$
The Prandtl number is not dependent on length and only the fluid and fluid state.
