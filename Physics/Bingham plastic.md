### Answer Lines
[[viscosity]]
## Notes
A **Bingham plastic** is a substance that is rigid at low [[stress]] but flows like a [[viscosity|viscous]] Newtonian [[fluid]] at high stress, meaning that its [[stress]], [[strain]] relation is linear:

The minimum stress required for flow is the **yield stress.**
