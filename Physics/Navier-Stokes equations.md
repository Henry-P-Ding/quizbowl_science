### Answer Lines
[[viscosity]]
## Notes
The **Navier-Stokes equations** are a set of partial [[differential equation|differential equations]] that describe the motion of a [[viscosity|viscous]] fluid. There are several forms:

In all of these forms, the [[gradient]] of [[pressure]] is found, while  [[viscosity]] is multiplied with the [[Laplacian]] of [[flow velocity]], while density is multiplied with [[gravitational acceleration]].
