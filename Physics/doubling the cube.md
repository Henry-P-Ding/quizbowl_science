[[doubling the cube]]
## Notes
**Doubling the cube** is an ancient geometric [[construction]] problem to create a new [[cube]] with a volume double of an original cube. 

Wantzel proved that this was impossible in 1837. Doubling the cube requires creating a line segment of length $2^{1/3}$, which is impossible to do by construction. 

However, it is possible to double the cube using [[neusis construction]], which requires a marked ruler.
