### Answer Lines
[[speed of sound]]
## Notes
The **Prandtl-Glauert transformation** solves compressible fluid flow problems using techniques for incompressible flow. It incorreectly predicts [[pressure|infinite pressures]] at the [[speed of sound]], leading people to believe the sound barrier was impossible to break in the early 20th century.
