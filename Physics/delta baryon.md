[[proton]]
## Notes
**Delta** [[baryons]] are a family of subatomic particles containing up and down [[quarks]]. Four $\Delta$ baryons exist:
- $\Delta^{++}$ (uuu): the $\ce{+2e}$ [[electric charge]] was crucial to developing the [[quark]] model
- $\Delta^{+}$ (uud): note that this is not identical to a proton but has an intrinsic [[spin]] of 3/2 instead of 1/2
- $\Delta^{0}$ (udd)
- $\Delta^{1}$ (ddd)

All $\Delta$ baryons quickly decay via the [[strong force]] into a [[nucleon]] and a [[pion]]. A more rare and slow decay process can involve $\ce{\Delta + -> p + \gamma}$ or $\ce{\Delta ^0 -> n + \gamma}$.
