### Answer Lines
[[Lamb shift]]
## Notes
The **Lamb shift** is a difference in the $^2S_{1/2}$ and $^2P_{1/2}$ energy levels of a [[hydrogen atom]] that is not predicted by the [[Dirac equation]].

It is caused by interactions between the hydrogen [[electron]] and [[vacuum]] energy fluctuations. The Lamb shift plays a role in explaining [[black hole|Hawking radiation]]. Lamb received the [[Nobel Prize]] in physics in 1955 for his discovery of the Lamb shift.
