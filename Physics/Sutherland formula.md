### Answer Lines
[[viscosity]]
## Notes
The **Sutherland formula** determines the temperature dependence of [[viscosity]] using an ideal gas model with a weak perturbative interaction:$$\mu = \mu_0\left(\frac{T}{T_0}\right)^{3/2}\frac{T_0 + S}{T+S}$$
for some constant $S$. The Sutherland model is a simple example of **Chapman-Enskog theory** which was developed in the 1980s to determine the temperature dependence of [[viscosity]].
