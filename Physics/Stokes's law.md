### Answer Lines
[[viscosity]]
## Notes
**Stokes's law** is an empirical law that applies for small [[Reynolds number|Reynolds numbers]] when viscous effects dominate:$$F = 6\pi\mu R u$$
- $\mu$ is [[viscosity|dynamic viscosity]]
- $R$ is a characteristic length
- $u$ is [[flow velocity]] relative to the object.
It was derived by [[Sir George Stokes]].
