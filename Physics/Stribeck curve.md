### Categories
[[physics]], [[tribology]]
### Answer Lines
[[friction]]
## Notes
The **Stribeck curve** plots the [[frictional coefficient]] vs. the [[Hersey number]] for surfaces contacted by [[lubricant]]. The graph has three regimes:
1. *Boundary Lubrication*: some contact/lubrication, friction mostly from [[asperities]]
2. *Mixed Lubrication*: both lubrication and asperities contribute
3. *Hydrodynamic Lubrication*: mostly lubricant, no asperity contribution
