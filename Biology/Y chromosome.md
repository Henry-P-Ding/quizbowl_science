### Answer Lines
[[Y chromosome]]
## Notes
The **Y chromosome** is the smallest human [[chromosome]] with 568 [[genes]]. The **SRY (sex-determining region)** gene initiates male sex determination in [[placenta|placental]] and [[marsupial]] [[mammals]].
### Shrinking Theory
The **Y chromosome shrinking** theory is the idea that the Y chromosome will shrink over time since there is no other Y chromosome in the human genome to perform repairs.
### Jacobs (XYY) Syndrome
Having an additional Y chromosome results in [[Jacobs syndrome]], which results in tallness, acne, and greater risk for learning disabilities.
