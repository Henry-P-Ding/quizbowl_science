### Answer Lines
[[phosphate]]
## Notes
A **nucleoside triphosphate** contains a [[nucleotide]], [[ribose]], and three [[phosphate]] groups.

Nucleoside triphosphate complement [[DNA]] templates made by [[DNA polymerase]] during [[DNA replication]]. When it is added to [[DNA]], two [[phosphate]] groups are removed to form a [[pyrophosphate]]. The energy released from removing the [[phosphate]] groups is then used to drive [[DNA polymerase]].
