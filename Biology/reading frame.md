# Notes
A **reading frame** is one of the possible three-nucleotide groupings in DNA. Since DNA is anti-parallel and contains two strands, there are six possible reading frames in DNA. 
* An **open reading frame** refers to the span of DNA sequence between start and stop codons. It has this name because it typically refers to [[prokaryote]] DNA where only one of the six reading frames are open.
