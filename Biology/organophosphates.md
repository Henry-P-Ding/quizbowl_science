### Answer Lines
[[phosphate]]
## Notes
**Organophosphates** refer [[organic chemistry|organic]] compounds containing [[phosphate]]. 

Organophosphates are primarily used in pest control. Organophosphates are [[nerve agents]] so they interfere with nerve signals by inhibiting [[AChE]] [[enzyme]], which degrades [[acetylcholine]], a [[neurotransmitter]].

They rapidly degrade from sunlight/air exposure so they do not persist to damage the environment.
