[[open reading frame]], [[human papillomavirus|HPV]]
# Notes
**Immediate early genes (IEGs)** are genes that are first expressed immediately and rapidly in a cell in response to stimuli, before requiring any new proteins. They are contrasted with [[late response gene]]s that require additional transcription factors in order to be expressed.
## Viruses
IEGs can be used to describe viral genes that synthesize proteins immediately following viral infection of a host cell. Two IEGs in [[human papillomavirus|HPV]] are E6 and E7, which produce E6 proteins that degrades [[p53 protein]], leading to [[cancer]].
