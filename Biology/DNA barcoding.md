[[DNA barcoding]], [[mitochondrial DNA]]
# Notes
**DNA barcoding** is the process of species identification by comparing a short sequence of [[DNA]] in a specific gene to a reference library of DNA. The most common sequence used are from the **cytochrome c oxidase I** gene in [[mitochondrial DNA]], since it has less intraspecific (within a species) variation than interspecific variation (between different species).
