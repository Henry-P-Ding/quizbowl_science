## Notes
A **signal transduction pathway** are a series of steps in a cell that converts signals to responses in the cell, usually with the following structure:

signal molecule $\rightarrow$ [[receptor]] $\rightarrow$ relay molecules $\rightarrow$ final protein for response

Relay molecules are often [[kinases|protein kinase]] which relay information by [[phosphorylation]].
