# Notes
A **synovial joint** is a joint that allows for free bone movement, such as the joint found in the [[elbow]]. It contains **synovial fluid** in its cavities, which is a non-Newtonian fluid that reduces friction in the joint.
## Bursitis
**Bursitis** is a condition where one or more sacs of synovial fluid known as a **bursae** are inflammed. It is most commonly caused by repetitive movement and excessive pressure.
