### Answer Lines
[[phosphate]]

## Notes
A **kinases** is an [[enzyme]] which catalyze the transfer of $\ce{PO4^3-}$ ([[phosphate]]).
### Protein Kinase
A **protein kinase** is an enzyme that [[phosphorylation|phosphorylates]] proteins, changing their the shape/activity of the protein. [[serine|Serine]] or [[threonine]] are common amino acids [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] by protein kinases. 

Protein kinases are often the relay molecules in [[signal transduction pathway|signal transduction pathways]].

The [[phosphorylation]] produced by protein kinases is often removed by [[phosphatases|protein phosphatases]], which recycle proteins for later protein kinase use.
