[[bacteriophage|phage]], [[bacteriophage]]

## Notes
A **bacteriophage** is a [[virus]] which infects [[bacteria]].
### T Phages
The most often studied bacteriophage are the seven "T" bacteriophages that infect [[E. coli.]]
 - **T2, T4, T6** are [[viral cycles|lytic]] bacteriophages and have a characteristic icosahedron head.

### Temperate Phages
A **temperate phage** is a page capable of both [[viral cycles|lytic/lysogenic cycles]]. A prominent example is the [[lambda bacteriophage]], which is used widely used by research. The **cro** and **cl** gene are represors that determine whether  a [[virus]] is in the [[viral cycles|lytic cycle]] or [[viral cycles|lysogenic cycle]].
