### Answer Lines
[[diabetes]]
## Notes
In **Type I diabetes**, [[pancrea|beta-pancreatic cells]] are destroyed by an autoimmune reaction, so [[insulin]] can not be secreted. In **Type II diabetes,** less severe than Type I, amyloids accumulate in beta-pancreatic cells, inhibiting their insulin production. Excess [[glucagon]] is secreted instead.
