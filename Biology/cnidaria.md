[[cnidaria]]

## Notes
***Cnidarians*** are a [[phylum]] of aquatic animals, with **cnidocytes** as their distinguishing feature. Cnidarians have a [[diploblastic]] and [[body plan|radial body plan]]. Common examples of cnidarians include [[hydra|hydras]], [[jellyfish]], and [[coral|corals]]:

### Cnidocytes
**Cnidocytes** are the distinguishing feature of [[cnidaria]], which are specialized cells on the tentacles of [[cnidaria]] designed to capture prey. **Cnidocytes** contain *cnidae*, organelles capable of shooting at prey once a signal is triggered to puncture the prey's body wall or ensnare it. **Nematocytes** are special cells containing *cnidae* with threads that can puncture the body walls of prey.

### Body Plan
The [[body plan]] of all [[cnidaria|cnidarians]] contains a **gastrovascular sac** for digestion and a single opening for both a [[mouth]] and [[anus]]. There are two variations for the body plan, the **polyp** and **medusa**. Some cnidarians can only exist in one body plan, but others can have multiple body plans throughout their life time.

#### Polyp Body Plan
**Polyps** are [[sessile]] body plans that adhere to surfaces on the end of their body opposite to the [[mouth]] (aboral) and extend tentacles around their mouth to catch prey.

#### Medusa Body Plan
**Medusa** are [[motile]] body plans, like flattened versions of polyps, that can move by passive drifting or contraction of their bodies.

#### Tissue layers
All cnidarians contain an outer [[epidermis]] tissue layer, a middle a layer, and an inner [[gastrodermis]] layer.
