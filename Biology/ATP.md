### Answer Lines
[[phosphate]]

## Notes
**Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)** contains three [[phosphate]] groups, a [[ribose]] group, and [[adenine]].

ATP is involved in a common biological [[exergonic]] reaction used for [[energy coupling]]:
$$
\ce{ATP + H2O -> ADP + P}
$$
[[ADP]] is the more stable molecule formed after releasing energy from loosing a [[phosphate]] group.
