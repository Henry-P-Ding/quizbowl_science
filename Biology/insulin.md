[[insulin]]
## Notes
**Insulin** is a peptide (protein) [[hormone]] secreted from [[pancrea|beta-pancreatic cells]]. 
- *function:* 
	- Leads uptake of [[glucose]] by the [[liver]], [[muscle]], and [[body fat|fats]], causing the **GLUT4** protein to attach to muscle and fat cells to absorb more glucose. The glucose is then converted into [[glycogen]] or [[lipid|lipids]]. 
	- Prevents production and secretion of glucose by the liver
