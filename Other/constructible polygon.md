## Notes
A **constructible polygon** is one that can be created by [[construction]] (using a compass and straightedge). 

The [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]-Wantzel theorem states that a regular $n$-gon ([[polygon]]) can be constructed iff $n$ is a power of $2$ or the product of $2$ and any number of distinct [[Fermat]] [[prime|primes]], which are of form $2^{(2^m)} + 1$. Using this theorem, the smallest $n$-gon that is not constructible is the [[heptagon]]. There are 31 constructible polygons with an [[odd number]] of sides, since there are 5 known Fermat primes.

[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] proved that the 17-gon is constructible.
