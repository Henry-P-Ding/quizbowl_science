## Notes
The **tangent half-angle substitution** allows any function of $\sin, \cos$ to be written as a rational function of $\tan(x/2)$ for integration:
$$
\int f(\sin x \cos x)\diff x = \int f\left(\frac{2t}{1+t^2}, \frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}\frac{2\diff t}{1+t^2}\right)
$$

The tangent half-angle substitution is also misattributed as the [[Weierstrass substitution trick]]
