### Answer Lines
[[helium]]
## Notes
The **CNO cycle** is a nuclear [[fusion]] cycle found in [[star|stars]] in which a [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], or [[oxygen]] atom is cycled in a process that converts [[hydrogen]] to [[helium]] to produce energy. While the [[proton-proton chain]] produces more energy for low mass stars, the CNO cycle produces the most energy in medium-mass stars.
### Cycle Specifics

The overall idea of the reaction is that a $\ce{C, N, O}$ atom is cycled throughout the cycle to convert input $\ce{H}$ into $\ce{He}$ to produce energy along with some [[positron]] and [[neutrino]] by-products.
