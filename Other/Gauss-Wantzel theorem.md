### Answer Lines
[[constructible polygon]]
## Notes
The [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]-Wantzel theorem states that a regular $n$-gon ([[polygon]]) can be constructed iff $n$ is a power of $2$ or the product of $2$ and any number of distinct [[Fermat]] [[prime|primes]], which are of form $2^{(2^m)} + 1$. This is because numbers corresponding to lengths extracted from [[construction]] can only be of quadratic order (roots to the power of two) to a starting number/length. Using this theorem, the smallest $n$-gon that is not constructible is the [[heptagon]]. There are 31 constructible polygons with an [[odd number]] of sides, since there are 5 known Fermat primes.
### Proof
The proof uses the fact that a polygon is constructible iff $\cos(2\pi/n)$ is a constructible number, meaning that $n$ must be a Fermat prime or a power of two. This is because numbers corresponding to lengths extracted from [[construction]] can only be of quadratic order (roots to the power of two) to a starting number/length. These constructible numbers are closed under the four basic arithmetic operations and square roots.
