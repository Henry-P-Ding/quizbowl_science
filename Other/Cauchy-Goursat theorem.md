[[connectedness]]
## Notes
The [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]]-Goursat theorem** states that if a [[complex number|complex]] function $f(z)$ is [[holomorphic]] in a [[connectedness|simply connected]] domain, then for any closed [[contour]] on that domain, the contour integral is zero:$$\int_Cf(z)\diff z = 0$$
