[[connectedness|connected set]]
## Notes
A [[topological space]] $X$ is **connected** if a [[separation]] of $X$ does not exist. A separation for a [[topological space]] $X$ is a pair $U, V$ of [[disjoint set|disjoint]] [[open set|open sets]] of $X$ whose [[union]] is $X$. Using the properties of a **connected space**, the [[intermediate value theorem]] can be prove.
