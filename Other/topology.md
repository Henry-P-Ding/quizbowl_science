## Notes
A **topology** $\mathcal{T}$ is a [[collection]] of subsets for a [[set]] $X$ that satisfy three properties:
1. $\varnothing$ ([[null set]]) and $X$ are in $\mathcal{T}$ 
2. The [[union]] of the elements of any subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.
3. The [[intersection]] of the elements of any finite subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.
The ordered pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ known as a [[topological space]].
