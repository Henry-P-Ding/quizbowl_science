## Notes
**Crystal field theory** is used to determine how [[ligand|ligands]], usually attached to [[coordination complex|transition metal coordination complexes]], split energy levels in [[electron orbital|electron orbitals]], usually the [[electron orbital|d orbital]] or [[electron orbital|f orbital]]. This explains the [[emission spectrum]] and [[absorption spectrum]] of different metals. Different levels of repulsion between ligands and orbitals result in a splitting of energy levels.
### Tetrahedral
![[Pasted image 20230414154353.png|center|100]]
The metal [[electron orbital|d orbital]] energy splitting value is $\Delta_t = -4\Delta_o/9$ of the octahedral value $\Delta_o$. Since this is typically lower than [[spin]] pairing energy, electron typically fill the higher energy $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ [[electron orbital|orbitals]] rather than pairing up spins, resulting in **high spin**, or many unpaired electrons.
### Square Planar
For the square planar molecule, the energy levels are

- $d_{x^2-y^2}$ is the highest since this orbital directly overlaps with the four ligand groups:![[Pasted image 20230413122113.png|center|200]]
The energy splitting value is $\Delta_{sp} = 1.74\Delta_o$, so the energy is typically higher than [[spin]] pairing energy. This results in **low spin**, or few unpaired electrons.
