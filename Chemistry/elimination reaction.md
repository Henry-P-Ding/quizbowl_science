[[elimination reaction]]
# Notes
An **elimination reaction** is a process in which a strong [[base]] is added to an [[alkane|alkyl]] [[halogen|halide]] $\ce{X}$. The two $\ce{C-X}$ and $\ce{C-H}$ bonds in the alkyl halide is broken to form a $\ce{C=C}$ [[pi bond]] double bond between the remaining carbons. The $\ce{X}$ and the cation in the base salt form a new salt, while the $\ce{H+}$ protonates the base. For example:![[Pasted image 20230603163250.png|center|400]]
