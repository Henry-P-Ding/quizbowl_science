## Notes
**Spin trapping** is a technique to identify [[free radical|free radicals]] using [[electron paramagnetic resonance|EPR spectroscopy]]. If half-lives of radicals is too short for EPR, spin traps can react with radicals to form a stabler product that can be detected by EPR. Common spin traps include [[PBN]] and [[DMPO]], both of which contain a [[nitrogen]] with a positive [[formal charge]] bonded with a negative [[oxygen]] atom.
