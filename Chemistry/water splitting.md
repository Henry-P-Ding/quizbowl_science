### Answer Lines
[[water splitting]]
## Notes
**Water splitting** is a chemical reaction that breaks down [[water]] into [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]]:$$\ce{2H2O -> O2 + 2H2}$$
Efficient water splitting would be a breakthrough for the use of [[hydrogen fuel cell]]. Water splitting is catalyzed efficiently by [[titanium]] dioxide.
