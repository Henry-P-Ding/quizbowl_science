# Notes
**Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)** contain fluorine bonded to an [[alkane|alkyl]] chain. One prominent example is [[Teflon]], which is used as a non-stick coating for pans. Many PFASs like Telfon are hydrophobic, unreactive, and water-resistant, due to the strength of the $\ce{C-F}$ bonds. For example:

## Environmental Impact
PFASs may have significant environmental impact because they persist in the environment, often called **"forever chemicals."**
