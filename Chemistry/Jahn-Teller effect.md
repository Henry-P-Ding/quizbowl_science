## Notes
The **Jahn-Teller effect** (JTE) is a mechanism in which molecules containing spatially [[electron orbital|degenerate orbitals]] will undergo a distortion to remove the degeneracy since it lowers the energy of the species. It is commonly encountered in [[molecular geometry|octahedral]] [[coordination complex|coordination complexes]] containing metals, such as six-coordinate [[copper|copper(II)]] complexes.
