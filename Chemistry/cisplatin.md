### Answer Lines
[[cisplatin]], [[molecular geometry|square planar]], [[four]], [[chlorine]], [[guanine]], [[ammonia]]
## Notes
**Cisplatin** is an important [[chemotherapy]] [[medicine]] used to treat [[cancer]]. It treats [[testicle|testicular]] cancer, [[ovary|ovarian]] cancer, cervical cancer, [[bladder]] cancer, [[head]] and [[neck]] cancer, [[esophagus|esophageal]] cancer, lung cancer, [[mesothelioma]], [[brain]] tumors, and [[neuroblastoma]]. 
### Structure
Cisplatin  is a [[molecular geometry|square planar]] [[coordination complex]] consisting of two [[ammonia]] ligands and two [[chlorine]] ligands bonded to [[platinum]].

### Function
Cisplatin interferes with [[DNA replication]], killing the fastest proliferating cells that are likely to be cancerous. When dissolved in water, a chlorine atom is replaced by a [[water]] molecule. This new compound is easily replaced by a [[nucleotide]] such as [[guanine]], which prefers to bind to cisplatin.
