[[catalyst poisoning]]
## Notes
**Catalyst poisoning** refers to chemical deactivation of a catalyst when a compound binds to active sites. The [[Lindlar catalyst]] is a prominent example of a [[catalyst]] that uses catalyst poisoning to selectively [[hydrogenation|hydrogenate]] [[alkynes]] to [[alkene]] without hydrogenating alkenes to [[alkane]]s.
