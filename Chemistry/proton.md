### Answer Lines
[[proton]]
## Notes
A **proton** (p, (uuu)) is a [[nucleon]] with positive [[electric charge|charge]] $\ce{+e}$. 
### Proton Radius Puzzle
The **proton radius puzzle** is an open problem in physics for the size of the proton. Prior to 2010, the proton's charge radius was determined by two methods to be around $0.877\;\mathrm{fm}$, but a new experiment using [[muon|muonic]] [[hydrogen]] in 2010 found a the radius to be 4% smaller. The new radius was established to be $0.84\;\mathrm{fm}$ after a 2022 re-analysis of the data.
