# Notes
**Electroplating** is a process in which metal is coated onto a solid by reducing metal cations in an electrolyte with an electric current. **Throwing power** measures the uniformity with which electroplating can coat metal around the substrate.
## Strike/Flash
A **strike** or **flash** is an initial thin, high quality coating that adheres well to the substrate as a foundation for subsequent electroplating. When a metal has poor adhesion to the substrate, a strike of an intermediate metal that has good adherence to both the metal and substrate to start electroplating.
## Electrotyping
**Electrotyping** or **galvanoplasty** is a method to make metal fit a mold exactly through electroplating. It was commonly used for creating printing plates in the late 1800s.
## Haring–Blum Cell
The **Haring–Blum cell** measures the throwing power of an electroplating process. It consists of two cathodes with an anode in between, closer to one cathode than the other:![[Pasted image 20230603154536.png|center|300]]
The ratio of coating between the left and right cathodes can be used to determine the throwing power.
