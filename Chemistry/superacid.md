### Answer Lines
[[superacid]]
## Notes
**Superacids** are acids with acidity greater than pure [[sulfuric acid]]. A common superacid is **fluoroantimonic acid** $\ce{H2FSbF6}$, which made by dissolving [[antimony]] [[fluorine|pentafluoride]] into [[hydrogen]] [[fluorine|fluoride]]. They are defined as acids with a [[Hammett function]] that is less than -12. Superacids can stabilize [[carboncation]]s, which allows them to be maintained and studied for reactions where they serve as intermediates.
