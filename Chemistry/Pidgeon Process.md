### Answer Lines
[[alkaline earth metal]], [[group 2]], [[magnesium]]
## Notes
The **Pidgeon process** is an industrial process for producing [[magnesium]] via a reaction with silicon:
$$
\ce{Si(s) + 2MgO(s) -> SiO2(s) + 2Mg(s)}
$$
Commonly, a cheap ferrosilicon alloy is used in the reaction, since iron does not participate in the reaction.
