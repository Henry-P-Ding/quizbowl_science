### Answer Lines
[[Irving Langmuir|Langmuir]], [[adsorption]]
# Notes
The **Langmuir adsorption model** models [[adsorption]] by treating the adsorbate as an isothermal [[ideal gas]] and the substrate as a perfectly flat, ideal solid surface. Only some sites are capable of binding the adsorbate through some chemical bonding process.![[Pasted image 20230603161645.png|center|300]]
