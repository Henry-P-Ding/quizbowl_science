### Answer Lines
[[Gibbs free energy]]

## Notes
The **chemical potential** $\mu$ is the energy absorbed/released due to the change in [[particle number]] of a species. Formally, it is defined, in terms of [[internal energy]] $U$, for species $i$ as:
$$
\mu_i = \left(\pdv{U}{N_i}\right)_{S, V, N_{j\neq i}}
$$
In terms of [[Gibbs free energy]] $G$:
$$
\mu_i = \left(\pdv{G}{N_i}\right)_{T, P, N_{j\neq i}}
$$
