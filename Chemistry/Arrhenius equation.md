### Answer Lines
[[pre-exponential factor]]
## Notes
The **Arrhenius equation** determines the [[rate constant]] as a function of [[temperature]] and [[activation energy]]:
$$k = Ae^{-E_a/RT}$$
where $A$ is the **pre-exponential factor**. In some models $A$ corresponds to the frequency of molecular collisions.

Note that the Arrhenius equation gives:
$$\ln(k) = \ln(A) + \frac{-E_a}{RT}$$
This means that the [[activation energy]] can be found by plotting $\ln k$ with $1/T$.
