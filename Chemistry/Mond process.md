[[carbon monoxide]]
## Notes
The **Mond process** or **carbonyl process** is used to extract and purify [[nickel]]. Since [[carbon monoxide]] easily forms nickel [[carbonyl]] gas and does not readily react with other compounds, nickel can be easily extracted.

It occurs in three steps:
1. First, nickel oxide is reacted with hydrogen gas to get nickel metal. $$\ce{NiO(s) + H2(g) -> Ni(s) + H2O(G)}$$
2. To purify and extract nickel, the nickel [[carbonyl]] gas is formed, which leaves behind solid impurities. $$\ce{Ni(s) + 4CO(g) -> Ni(CO)4(g)}$$
3. Heating nickel carbonyl with [[syngas]] decomposes it:$$\ce{Ni(CO)4(g) -> Ni(s) + 4CO(g)}$$
