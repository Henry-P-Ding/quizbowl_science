### Answer Lines
[[carbon monoxide]]
## Notes
**Carbon monoxide** has formula $\ce{CO}$ with Lewis structure:

Compounds or process related to or containing [[carbonyl]] in the name are often associated with $\ce{CO}$, such the [[Mond process]] and [[polycarbonyl]]. 

$\ce{CO}$ has the highest bond-dissociation of any neutral molecule. (can be disputed)

### $\ce{CO}$ Poisoning
**Carbon monoxide poisoning** occurs when $\ce{CO}$ binds with [[hemoglobin]], preventing blood from carrying oxygen. This is problematic since $\ce{CO}$'s affinity for hemoglobin is 240x higher than $\ce{O}$.

Exposure to [[DCM]] can result in carbon monoxide poisoning, since it is metabolized to form $\ce{CO}$. 

### Neurotransmitter
$\ce{CO}$ is a gaseous [[neurotransmitter]] produced by the [[enzyme]] **heme oxygenase** in the [[brain]] and the [[peripheral nervous system|PNS]].
